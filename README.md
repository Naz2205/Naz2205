Hey there, fellow coders! My name is Nazerke, but you can call me Naz for short. I hail from the great land of Kazakhstan, where the horses roam free and the code runs even freer.

When I'm not busy wrangling code, you can find me brushing up on my language skills. That's right, I'm a polyglot, speaking four languages fluently. If you need help translating your code into Kazakh, Russian, English or French (alright, this one is Intermediate), I'm your gal.

My true passion lies in Python backend development. I love nothing more than diving deep into complex problems and emerging victorious with elegant solutions. If you're looking for a backend developer who can turn your dreams into code, I will be happy to be the one.

Oh, and I almost forgot to mention - I'm not just all talk. I've got the skills to back it up. I recently finished an online course on Python development through Stepik and I'm currently taking three courses to further hone my craft: advanced Python, SQL, and a 10-month paid course on Python development. Luckily, I received a scholarship from Astana Hub, which is allowing me to pursue my passion without breaking the bank.

So, if you're looking for a developer who's not afraid to put in the work and stay up-to-date on the latest technologies, look no further. Let's work together to create something truly amazing.

So come join me on this wild ride through the world of coding. We'll laugh, we'll cry, we'll write some killer code together. Let's do this!
